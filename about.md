Hi, I am Madhukara Putty. I started this blog to understand a bit of quantum
mechanics, quantum computing, and quantum information. 

I write because I generally do not understand ANYTHING until I write. This
makes my learning terribly slow, but I have to live with it. I have
another [blog](https://puttym.github.io) where I write mostly about stuff
related to computer programming.

This blog is also an experiment. I am curious to see if I continue to learn
quantum mechanics and computation at least for a decade. I would be pleasantly
surprised if I did so. 

You can say hi to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/msputty26).
